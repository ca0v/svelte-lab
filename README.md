# Svelte + TS + Vite

This is a playground for ideas that I code using Svelte.

Updated using `>npm create vite@latest`

See the [live](https://ca0v.github.io/svelte-lab) site.

## What does it do?

I am building a Svelte components to facilitate creating an animated scrapbook.
The "HexagonSpiral" is both an editor and a display component.  
It accepts a list of images and allows for editing the layout.
It can also accept an initial state.

| Command | Description |
| - | - |
| " " | Swap with center |
| Arrow Keys | Move the image |
| + and - | Zoom the image |

Up next: "0..9" and "A..Z" to swap with another cell
